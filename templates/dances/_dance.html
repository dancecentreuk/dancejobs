    Along with all the fun and laughter the teacher will teach you a dance routine from the dance style of your choice.

There will be lots of opportunities to take photos and have breaks where required and of course the Bride to be will be the centre of attention. From our popular dirty dancing workshop to the fun street dance and the saucy Burlesque, what ever you choose you will be sure of a memorable and fun time with the girls.
