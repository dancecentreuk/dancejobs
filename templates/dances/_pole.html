     FAQ's <br>

    </span>


    What clothes should you wear? : Shorts and vest tops are best as bare flesh facilitates pole grip. You may want to bring some track suit bottoms to put on during warm up/cool down. Most importantly you need to wear something you feel comfortable in; so normal work-out clothes are fine.
    <br>

What shoes should you wear? Light weight training shoes are best. I recommend dance trainers or jazz shoes. You may also bring a pair of High heels if you wish.
    <br>

Why shouldn't I apply lotion, oil or moisturising cream prior to class? These make the pole slippery and decreases pole grip which is undesirable.
